/*
	need to figure out how this is going to work, what inputs it's going to take in
	- take in car2-12 as well as frog_x and frog_y
		- NOTE: need to figure out whether the x and y coord stuff is lining up as expected (pretty sure it is)
		- coords are rotated pretty sure. I think the rightmost column -> x = 0
	- easiest method: just take in GreenPixels and RedPixels
